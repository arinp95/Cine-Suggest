# CineSuggest üé¨üçø
This project implements a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System using Python and machine learning techniques. The system recommends movies based on user preferences by analyzing movie attributes such as genre, director, description, and cast. It uses a preprocessed dataset to compute similarity scores between movies, allowing it to suggest films that closely match a user's taste.

## Key features of the project include:

- **Text Vectorization:** The movie data, including descriptions and genres, is vectorized using techniques like TF-IDF.
- **Similarity Metrics:** Cosine similarity is employed to find movies that are closest in characteristics to a given film or set of preferences.
- **Interactive Interface:** Deployed as a web application using Streamlit, providing an intuitive interface for users to get personalized movie recommendations.
- **Customization:** Users can select or input a movie, and the system will generate a list of similar movies.
- **Scalability:** Easily extendable to include additional features, such as user ratings or hybrid recommendation methods.

This project serves as an example of how content-based filtering can be applied to create personalized recommendation systems. It is ideal for those interested in exploring the intersection of data science, machine learning, and application development.
